# Crate code-structure review implementation notes

This file records implementation details, deviations, and review points for the
checkboxes in `crate-code-structure-review.md`. The review checklist remains a
working document and is intentionally not committed with these changes.

## F16-A — Extract `NodeStore`

- Moved the node codec, node/root/leaf persistence, and observation-bound
  `LeafEdit` into `node_store.rs`. `ShardStore` retains explicit one-line node
  delegates and exposes `nodes()` for the staged migration; it does not use
  `Deref` or a generic compatibility conversion.
- The extracted store is built from a clone of the same `CachedStore`, preserving
  cache evidence, timeline ordering, warm-read operation counts, and CAS error
  mappings.
- Moved the six existing node-store behavior tests to the new owner and kept
  their semantic and operation-count assertions. Added one long-term pagination
  regression covering a listing larger than the 128-object backend page.
- No persistent bytes, retry policy, deterministic scheduling, or public runtime
  behavior changed. The only compatibility surface added is `NodeStore` plus
  `ShardStore::nodes()`, as required by the migration plan.
- Adversarial review found no correctness, operation-count, format, scope, or
  long-term test-value issues.

## F16-B — Extract `StructuralLogStore`

- Moved the structural-log codec, path/participant validation, conditional CRUD,
  and paginated listings into `structural_log_store.rs`. `ShardStore` keeps
  explicit delegates and exposes `structural_logs()` until F16-D migrates the
  protocol owners.
- Both typed stores are still derived from the same `CachedStore`, preserving
  cache coordination, observations, sequence points, and backend operation
  ordering.
- Moved the existing participant and pagination regressions to the new owner.
  Added one compact long-term lifecycle test for the successful phase update,
  stale-observation conflict, and deletion path.
- Persistent bytes, page size, prefix scope, retry behavior, and CAS error
  mappings are unchanged.
- Adversarial review found no correctness, safety, API, pagination, or excessive-
  test issue; generic cached-store coverage already owns missing-delete
  convergence, so it was not duplicated here.

## F16-C — Narrow `TreeRouter` to `NodeStore`

- `TreeRouter` now owns only `NodeStore`; its production module has no
  structural-log-capable handle. All composition sites explicitly pass the node
  capability through `ShardStore::nodes()`.
- Routing control flow, read requirements, cache-hit aggregation, stale-parent
  correction, and terminal freshness checks were not changed. Existing router
  behavior and backend-operation-count tests remain the long-term acceptance
  coverage.
- No compatibility conversion or one-implementation abstraction was added, and
  no migration-only tests were introduced.
- Adversarial review found no code issue or capability backdoor. It identified
  one stale architecture sentence naming `ShardStore`; that documentation now
  names the narrowed `NodeStore` handle.

## F16-D — Wire structural logs explicitly

- `Splitter` and `Gc` now receive `StructuralLogStore` explicitly, while
  `ShardStore` has lost its structural-log state, accessor, and delegation
  methods. This completes the temporary façade migration without a compatibility
  backdoor.
- Engine and test composition derive node and structural-log stores from clones
  of the same `CachedStore`, preserving shared cache evidence, timeline identity,
  observations, and backend-operation counts.
- Every split, recovery, participant-settlement, and GC structural-log operation
  changed only its receiver. Protocol awaits and ordering, retry behavior,
  random draws, task spawn order, and persistent bytes are unchanged.
- No migration-only tests were added. Existing structural-log lifecycle and
  pagination tests plus split recovery, restart, participant cleanup, and GC
  regressions remain the long-term coverage.
- Adversarial review found no code or protocol issue. It identified stale storage
  architecture documentation, which now shows the explicit structural-log
  component and its `_s` recovery records.

## F05-E — Extract structural recovery behind `Splitter`

- Added a private concrete `StructuralRecovery` that owns durable log discovery,
  source-writer fencing, recovery classification and cleanup, separator
  publication state, and topology-participant settlement. `Splitter` remains the
  background-loop facade and owns recursive parent splitting.
- Recovery-to-split coordination uses resumable named actions rather than a
  callback or backreference. The same separator-publication freshness epoch and
  retry budget survive a requested parent split before recovery deletes its
  exact structural-record observation.
- Freshness barriers, source-fencing and reachability order, child cleanup order,
  participant scoping and final removal, background wake/delay/spawn behavior,
  random draws, backend operations, and persistent bytes are unchanged.
- No migration-only tests were added. The existing roll-forward regression was
  strengthened after adversarial review to force the recovery-specific parent
  split action after separator publication and retain it as long-term
  crash-recovery coverage.
- The architecture module inventory now identifies the extracted recovery owner.
  No ADR was added because this extraction changes neither protocol nor external
  architectural contract.

## F17-A — Add the traversal matrix

- Added a test-only routing matrix for stale roots, stale leaf parents, interior
  right hops, and sibling-chain traversal before changing production traversal.
  All public `TreeRouter` entry points are covered where the topology applies.
- Independent cache views and exact ordered backend traces pin cold reads, warm
  zero-read routing, conditional freshness checks, terminal-only fresh routing,
  and cumulative cache-hit evidence. Complementary warm-prefix/cold-right and
  cold-prefix/warm-terminal cases prove every visit is ANDed and a later hit
  cannot erase an earlier miss.
- A three-leaf chain pins complete sibling order and inclusive middle-bound
  stopping without reading past the bound. `next_leaf`, which starts from a
  retained locator rather than a root descent, has direct right-link freshness,
  cumulative-hit, and malformed-reference coverage.
- The broader matrix replaced narrower stale-parent, stale-root, leaf-order,
  interior-freshness, and ordinary parent-lookup tests. The router suite now has
  nine tests rather than ten; distinct single-root, absence, separator-boundary,
  grouping-order, classification, and single-leaf-parent contracts remain.
- The first adversarial review rejected shared warm-cache rows and discarded
  operation logs. The revised matrix uses independent rows, asserts every trace,
  and adds mixed-hit, bounded-chain, and observation-kind/membership checks
  identified across the two review rounds.

## F17-B — Introduce `DescentCursor`

- Added a private cursor that carries the typed collection prefix, current
  requirement, location, observation, and route-wide cache-hit evidence.
  Leaf lookup, optional bootstrap, leftmost descent, and terminal freshness now
  share its root/right/child traversal.
- `leaf_for_fresh` still descends interiors at its original requirement, reloads
  only the exact terminal path when requirements differ, and resumes descent if
  that refreshed node became an index. No public API or error classification
  changed.
- Topology queries retain only a thin cursor-normalization adapter until F17-C;
  sibling-chain APIs remain deliberately unchanged for F17-D. The committed
  F17-A matrix passed without modification.
- Adversarial review found no semantic, currentness, cache-hit, or operation-
  ordering issue. Its only finding was an avoidable temporary `String` allocation
  on stale right hops; the cursor now parses the borrowed token directly.

## F17-C — Reuse the cursor for topology queries

- `token_reachable_at_key` and `parent_index_for` now use one cursor-owned
  traversal loop with synchronous stopping policies. Target reachability compares
  the normalized path before leaf termination; parent lookup retains the deepest
  normalized index only after its selected child loads successfully.
- The policies preserve their intentionally different absence contracts:
  reachability maps a dangling selected link to `false`, while parent lookup
  propagates `NotFound`. Neither query loads a requested target directly, and the
  returned parent evidence excludes the terminal child read as before.
- Public APIs, requirements, error messages, cache-hit aggregation, and backend
  operation order are unchanged. Sibling-chain traversal remains separate for
  F17-D, and no migration-only test was added.
- Adversarial review found the production extraction clean but identified missing
  long-term coverage for absent roots/targets and dangling links. One compact
  interface test now pins those results, the asymmetric errors, and the absence
  of a direct target read.
